# ARM Ansible Lab
Project template for Ansible and Terraform.

next steps:
figure out how to use tailscale so we can proxy trafic from a VPS to local rasperry
https://tailscale.com/pricing

main goal of this project is to have a selfhosting server that can be accessed from anywhere.
for now the selfhosting server will be a raspberry pi 5 in my home network so i don't want to open ports on my router. and use tailscale to access it from anywhere.



selfhosting list:

pi-hole
vaultwarden
jellyfin
